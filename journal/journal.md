### Related project 1 ###
Security Box

https://make.techwillsaveus.com/microbit/activities/security-box

![Image](related1.png)

This project is related to the project that I am creating because it sets off an alarm. This is a feature that is being utilised in my project.  The alarm in this project is used to alert the owner when someone has opened the box, whereas the alarm in my project is being used to alert the user when it is time to have another drink. 

### Related project 2 ###
Countdown Timer

How its similar - This project is similar to the project that I am creating because it involves a timer that countdown. In my project, the timer will reactivate every 5 minutes, this will then trigger an output that tells the user it is time to drink once again. 

### Related Project 3 ###
Making a Room Alarm with Micro: bit

How its similar - This project is similar to the project that I am creating because it once again is an alarm. This is a factor that is going to be used in this project. However, this alarm is activated when it is trigger, acting as a security system, whereas my project has an alarm that goes off after a certain time rather than when it is triggered.

How its similar - This project is similar to the project that I am creating because it displays a string of text on the micro: bit LED screen. My project will display the words “drink water” when the timer is up.

This project is related to the project that I am creating because it uses a motor to control the temperature gauge. I will be using a motor in my project to turn the platform that the water bottle sits on.

This project is related to the project that I am creating because it is a timer. In my project, I will be using an automatic countdown timer to indicate when the outputs go off. This project lets the individual once the egg has finished cooking using an automatic timer.

### *Brief resource name/description* ###
https://makecode.microbit.org/device/servo

As I have not tested the motor yet, I am unsure as to whether I will need to use a mini servo instead in my project to assist with the turning of the water bottles platform. This site explains how to equip the servo with “crocodile clips” that have been created from male strips. 

https://makecode.microbit.org/v0/86038-41904-40055-73164

The following source shows the code required for an alarm to play. This can be beneficial when creating the code for this project as it assists in creating alarm reminding the user to drink water. 

https://www.kitronik.co.uk/blog/using-bbc-microbit-control-servo/

This source explains how to use the BBC Micro: bit to control the servo. This is important as it will assist me in getting the servo to work effectively and spin the platform at the correct speed.

In the past, I have had issues attempting to get the micro: bit to work. This website gives me a step by step guide as to how to get the micro: bit working again if the issues reoccur. This is extremely beneficial as it can endure that I do not waste time trying to fix the micro: bit on my own.


## Conceptual development ##

### Design intent ###
In today's society, it is extremely common for people to forget to remain hydrated due to their busy schedule. This project will remind users when they need to drink water to ensure that they remain hydrated and healthy throughout the day. 

### Design ideation ###
<!--- Document your ideation process. This will include the design concepts presented for assessment 2. You can copy and paste that information here. --->

## Process documentation ##
<!--- In this section, include text and images (and potentially links to video) that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.

This should have quite a lot of information! It will likely include most of the process documentation from assessment 2 which can be copied and pasted here.

Use subheadings to structure this information. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for details of how to insert subheadings.

There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. --->

## Final code ##

<!--- Include here screenshots of the final code you used in the project if it is done with block coding. If you have used javascript, micropython, C, or other code, include it as text formatted as code using a series of three backticks ` before and after the code block. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for more information about that formatting. --->

## Design process discussion ##
<!--- Discuss your process used in this project, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process. --->


## Reflection ##

<!--- Describe the parts of your project you felt were most successful and the parts that could have done with improvement, whether in terms of outcome, process, or understanding.

What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?

What parts of your project do you feel are novel? This is IMPORTANT to help justify a key component of the assessment rubric.

What might be an interesting extension of this project? In what other contexts might this project be used? --->
