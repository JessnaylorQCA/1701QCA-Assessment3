The image should be inserted with code like that below where you replace the filename to exactly match what you uploaded. This will only work reliably if your filename has no spaces or unusual characters in it. The image must be in .jpg, .gif, .png format. Files of .heic or .heif type will not show up. Note that .png is different to .PNG in a filename here. The names are case sensitive.

This is the WaterFlow, a personal water hydration Reminder System. This item is for the many individuals who find it difficult to remain hydrated due to their busy work lives. Users would place their water bottles inside the bottle compartment and every 10 minutes, they will be reminded to drink water.

<!--- PROJECT VIDEO: Provide a still image from your video and a link to the video below. In that code, replace `missingimage.png` with the still from your video and the URL of the video where indicated. If you link to a password protected video, you must include the password in the document you submit through Learning@Griffith. Failing to have a video that we can access might lead to significant reduction in marks, potentially as much as if the video has not been submitted at all. --->
